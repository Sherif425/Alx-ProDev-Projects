-   Manual QA review was done on Jun 30, 2025 12:55 AM
-   An auto review will be launched at the deadline

#### In a nutshell‚Ä¶

-   **Manual QA review:** 15.0/15 mandatory
-   **Auto QA review:** 9.0/9 mandatory
-   **Altogether:** ¬†**100.0%**
    -   Mandatory: 100.0%
    -   Optional: no optional tasks

**Overall comment:**

Well done

#### **Overview**

The Airbnb Clone is a backend application designed to mimic the core functionality of Airbnb. It will provide a RESTful API (or GraphQL) that handles user accounts, property listings, booking reservations, and payment processing. This documentation phase focuses on creating a blueprint for the system, covering everything from high-level feature lists to low-level API specifications before a single line of code is written.

#### **Learning Objectives**

By completing this documentation project, you will learn how to:

-   **Translate project requirements** into a structured list of features and functionalities.
-   **Model system interactions** visually using Use Case Diagrams to identify actors and their goals.
-   **Articulate user needs** by writing clear User Stories that guide development from a user-centric perspective.
-   **Map data movement** through the system using Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to understand how information is processed.
-   **Detail specific processes** with Flowcharts to define logical sequences and decision points.
-   **Write precise technical specifications** that define API endpoints, data validation, and system behavior for developers.
-   **Utilize diagramming tools** like Draw.io to create professional and clear technical diagrams.

#### **Key Concepts**

-   **Backend Architecture:** The structure of the server-side application, including routers, controllers, models, and services.
-   **RESTful API Design:** Creating endpoints that adhere to REST principles using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
-   **Data Modeling:** Designing the database schema (e.g., using SQL like PostgreSQL or NoSQL) to efficiently store and relate data (Users, Properties, Bookings, etc.).
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implementing mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify user identity (AuthN) and control access to resources (AuthZ).
-   **Payment Gateway Integration:** Securely processing payments using third-party services like Stripe or PayPal.
-   **Documentation:** The practice of creating clear, maintainable, and comprehensive guides and specifications for a software project.

#### **Tools and Libraries**

-   **Draw.io / Diagrams.net:** A free, online diagramming tool for creating Use Case Diagrams, DFDs, and Flowcharts.
-   **Git & GitHub:** For version control and hosting the documentation repository.
-   **Markdown:** A lightweight markup language for formatting the `README.md` and other documentation files.
-   **Node.js & Express.js (Potential):** Likely JavaScript runtime and web framework for building the backend.
-   **Database (Potential):** PostgreSQL ( relational) or MongoDB (non-relational).
-   **Authentication (Potential):** bcrypt for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for JWTs.
-   **Payments (Potential):** Stripe API SDK.

#### **Real-World Use Case**

This documentation directly simulates the initial phases of a real-world software development lifecycle (SDLC) at any tech company. Before engineers start coding, Product Managers, System Analysts, and Technical Leads collaborate to produce exactly these kinds of artifacts:

1.  **Product Requirements Doc (PRD):** The list of features (Task 0).
2.  **System Design Mockups:** Use Case and Data Flow diagrams (Tasks 1 & 3).
3.  **Agile/Scrum Backlog Items:** User Stories (Task 2).
4.  **Technical Specifications:** Detailed API and requirement docs (Task 5). This process ensures everyone is aligned, reduces development errors, and provides a clear roadmap for the engineering team.

#### üìù Project Assessment (Hybrid)

Your project will be evaluated primarily through **manual reviews**. To ensure you receive your full score, please:

‚úÖ Complete your project on time  
üìÑ Submit all required files  
üîó Generate your review link  
üë• Have your peers review your work

An **auto-check** will also be in place to verify the presence of core files needed for manual review.

##### ‚è∞ Important Note

If the deadline passes, you won‚Äôt be able to generate your review link‚Äîso be sure to submit on time!

We‚Äôre here to support your learning journey. Happy coding! ‚ú®
