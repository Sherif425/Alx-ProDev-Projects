# Project Requirements for the Airbnb Clone Backend

### üéØ Objective:

Learners will **identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend** by understanding the technical and functional requirements necessary for building a scalable, secure, and robust system.

### üìö **Introduction to Project Requirements**

Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application. In this concept page, we will focus on the backend requirements for the **Airbnb Clone project**, emphasizing the key features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.

The requirements outlined below are categorized into **Core Functionalities**, **Technical Requirements**, and **Non-Functional Requirements**.

## üîë **Core Functionalities**

The backend for the Airbnb Clone must enable key features that align with the functionalities of a rental marketplace.

### 1\. **User Management**

-   **User Registration**:  
    -   Allow users to sign up as **guests** or **hosts**.  
        
    -   Use secure authentication methods like **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.  
        
-   **User Login and Authentication**:  
    -   Implement login via email and password.  
        
    -   Include **OAuth** options (e.g., Google, Facebook).  
        
-   **Profile Management**:  
    -   Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.  
        

### 2\. **Property Listings Management**

-   **Add Listings**:  
    -   Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.  
        
-   **Edit/Delete Listings**:  
    -   Hosts can update or remove their property listings.  
        

### 3\. **Search and Filtering**

-   Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties by:  
    -   Location  
        
    -   Price range  
        
    -   Number of guests  
        
    -   Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)  
        
-   Include pagination for large datasets.  
    

### 4\. **Booking Management**

-   **Booking Creation**:  
    -   Guests can book a property for specified dates.  
        
    -   Prevent double bookings using date validation.  
        
-   **Booking Cancellation**:  
    -   Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.  
        
-   **Booking Status**:  
    -   Track booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.  
        

### 5\. **Payment Integration**

-   Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:  
    -   Upfront payments by guests.  
        
    -   Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed.  
        
-   Include support for multiple currencies.  
    

### 6\. **Reviews and Ratings**

-   Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.  
    
-   Hosts can respond to reviews.  
    
-   Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.  
    

### 7\. **Notifications System**

-   Implement email and in-app notifications for:  
    -   Booking confirmations  
        
    -   Cancellations  
        
    -   Payment updates  
        

### 8\. **Admin Dashboard**

-   Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:  
    -   Users  
        
    -   Listings  
        
    -   Bookings  
        
    -   Payments  
        

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Requirements**

### 1\. **Database Management**

-   Use a relational database such as **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.  
    
-   Required tables:  
    -   Users (guests and hosts)  
        
    -   Properties  
        
    -   Bookings  
        
    -   Reviews  
        
    -   Payments  
        

### 2\. **API Development**

-   Use **RESTful APIs** to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.  
    
-   Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:  
    -   GET (retrieve data)  
        
    -   POST (create data)  
        
    -   PUT/PATCH (update data)  
        
    -   DELETE (remove data)  
        
-   Use **GraphQL** for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).  
    

### 3\. **Authentication and Authorization**

-   Use **JWT** for secure user sessions.  
    
-   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:  
    -   Guests  
        
    -   Hosts  
        
    -   Admins  
        

### 4\. **File Storage** (Scenario based)

-   Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary**. For implementation, we will use file storage

### 5\. **Third-Party Services**

-   Use email services like **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** for email notifications.  
    

### 6\. **Error Handling and Logging**

-   Implement global error handling for APIs.  
    

## üöÄ **Non-Functional Requirements**

### 1\. **Scalability**

-   Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.  
    
-   Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.  
    

### 2\. **Security**

-   Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.  
    
-   Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.  
    

### 3\. **Performance Optimization**

-   Use **caching** tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).  
    
-   Optimize database queries to reduce server load.  
    

### 4\. **Testing**

-   Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like **pytest** .  
    
-   Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
