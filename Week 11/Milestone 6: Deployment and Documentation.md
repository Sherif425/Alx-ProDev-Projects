# Milestone 6: Deployment and Documentation

-   Novice
-   Weight: 1
-   Project will start Sep 1, 2025 1:00 AM, must end by Sep 8, 2025 1:00 AM
-   Checker was released at Sep 1, 2025 1:00 AM
-   **Manual QA review must be done** (request it when you are done with the project)
-   An auto review will be launched at the deadline

### **Overview**

This task focuses on deploying a Django application to a production-ready cloud server and ensuring all features, including background tasks and API documentation, are fully functional in the live environment. Learners will gain practical experience with server deployment, Celery task queues, and Swagger API documentation, enabling them to bridge the gap between local development and production systems.

### **Learning Objectives**

By completing this task, learners will:

1.  Understand how to deploy a Django application to various cloud hosting platforms.
2.  Learn how to configure and manage environment variables in a production environment.
3.  Set up and run Celery workers with RabbitMQ for background processing.
4.  Configure and make Swagger API documentation publicly accessible.
5.  Test and validate application functionality in a live environment.

### **Learning Outcomes**

Upon successful completion, learners will be able to:

-   Deploy Django applications to production cloud servers such as AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean, or PythonAnywhere.
-   Securely configure and manage environment variables on a remote server.
-   Integrate and manage Celery workers with RabbitMQ for asynchronous task handling.
-   Publish API documentation using Swagger for public access.
-   Perform functional testing on deployed applications to ensure production readiness.

### **Key Concepts**

-   **Cloud Deployment**: Moving applications from local development to live hosting environments.
-   **Environment Variables**: Storing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, DB credentials) securely.
-   **Celery Task Queue**: Handling asynchronous tasks in Django applications.
-   **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for managing task queues.
-   **Swagger UI**: Interactive documentation for API endpoints.
-   **Production Testing**: Verifying live application functionality post-deployment.

### **Tools and Libraries**

-   **Python Django** ‚Äì Web framework for application development.
-   **Celery** ‚Äì Asynchronous task queue for background jobs.
-   **RabbitMQ** ‚Äì Message broker for Celery communication.
-   **Swagger / drf-yasg** ‚Äì API documentation generation.
-   **Cloud Hosting Platforms** ‚Äì AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean, PythonAnywhere.
-   **Gunicorn / uWSGI** ‚Äì WSGI servers for serving Django in production.
-   **NGINX** ‚Äì Reverse proxy server for production setups.
