#### Overview

This project demonstrates advanced Python techniques for managing database connections and executing queries using context managers and asynchronous programming. It provides three key implementations: a custom context manager for database connections, a reusable query executor, and concurrent asynchronous database operations.

#### Learning Objectives

-   Implement class-based context managers using `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods
-   Understand resource management and automatic cleanup with context managers
-   Master asynchronous database operations using `aiosqlite`
-   Implement concurrent query execution with `asyncio.gather`
-   Handle database connections and queries in a Pythonic way

#### Key Concepts

##### Context Managers

Context managers ensure proper resource acquisition and release using the `with` statement pattern. The `__enter__` method handles resource setup, while `__exit__` guarantees cleanup even if exceptions occur.

##### Database Connection Management

Proper connection management prevents resource leaks and ensures database integrity. Context managers automatically handle connection opening/closing.

##### Asynchronous Programming

Using `async/await` syntax with `aiosqlite` enables non-blocking database operations, allowing multiple queries to execute concurrently for improved performance.

##### Concurrent Execution

`asyncio.gather()` allows multiple asynchronous operations to run simultaneously, significantly reducing total execution time for independent queries.

#### Tools and Libraries

-   **sqlite3**: Standard Python library for SQLite database interactions
-   **aiosqlite**: Async-compatible SQLite library for asynchronous operations
-   **asyncio**: Python‚Äôs built-in asynchronous programming framework
-   **Contextlib**: Utilities for creating context managers

#### Real-World Use Cases

##### Web Application Backends

Context managers ensure database connections are properly closed after each request, preventing connection leaks in high-traffic web applications.

##### Data Processing Pipelines

Reusable query context managers simplify ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes where multiple similar queries need execution with different parameters.

##### Analytics Dashboards

Concurrent asynchronous queries allow dashboards to fetch multiple datasets simultaneously, providing faster load times for users viewing complex reports.

##### Microservices Architecture

Asynchronous database operations enable services to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently, improving scalability in distributed systems.

##### Automated Testing

Context managers ensure test databases are properly cleaned up after each test case, maintaining test isolation and reliability.

## Tasks

##### 0\. custom class based context manager for Database connection

mandatory

Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

**Objective:** create a class based context manager to handle opening and closing database connections automatically

**Instructions:**

-   Write a class custom context manager `DatabaseConnection` using the `__enter__` and the `__exit__` methods
    
-   Use the context manager with the `with` statement to be able to perform the query `SELECT * FROM users`. Print the results from the query.

##### 1\. Reusable Query Context Manager

mandatory

Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

**Objective:** create a reusable context manager that takes a query as input and executes it, managing both connection and the query execution

**Instructions:**

-   Implement a class based custom context manager `ExecuteQuery` that takes the query: `‚ÄùSELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?‚Äù` and the parameter `25` and returns the result of the query
    
-   Ensure to use the`__enter__()` and the `__exit__()` methods

##### 2\. Concurrent Asynchronous Database Queries

mandatory

Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

**Objective:** Run multiple database queries concurrently using `asyncio.gather`.

**Instructions:**

-   Use the `aiosqlite` library to interact with SQLite asynchronously. To learn more about it, [click here](/rltoken/Dp_5xrVa75wVwJSv5udTpA "click here").
    
-   Write two asynchronous functions: `async_fetch_users()` and `async_fetch_older_users()` that fetches all users and users older than 40 respectively.
    
-   Use the `asyncio.gather()` to execute both queries concurrently.
    
-   Use `asyncio.run(fetch_concurrently())` to run the concurrent fetch
