**Overall comment:**

Project was failed automatically.

#### Overview

Middleware is a powerful feature in application design that acts as a bridge between the request and response phases of the application cycle. In this project, learners will explore the concept of middleware, learn how to write custom middleware, and implement logic such as request interception, permission enforcement, request data filtering, logging, and more. Learners will also examine real-world use cases, such as authentication and rate-limiting, and understand the best practices when integrating middleware into a Django application.

This hands-on project will guide you in building a series of middleware components for an Airbnb Clone or similar web application, allowing them to understand middleware‚Äôs role in clean architecture and modular backend development.

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, learners should be able to:

-   Understand the concept and lifecycle of middleware in Django.
-   Create custom middleware to intercept and process incoming requests and outgoing responses.
-   Filter and modify request/response data at the middleware level.
-   Implement access control mechanisms using middleware.
-   Use middleware to enforce API usage policies like rate limiting or request validation.
-   Integrate third-party middleware and understand Django‚Äôs default middleware stack.
-   Apply best practices for organizing middleware logic in a scalable project.

#### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion, learners will:

-   Define and explain how Django middleware works within the request/response cycle.  
    
-   Write and integrate custom middleware in a Django project.  
    
-   Use middleware to enforce permissions and restrict access based on roles, IP, or headers.  
    
-   Filter and clean incoming request data before reaching the views.  
    
-   Log request and response metadata for auditing or debugging purposes.  
    
-   Separate concerns effectively using middleware rather than overloading views.  
    
-   Evaluate the trade-offs and limitations of using middleware for certain functionalities.

#### Implementation Tasks

Learners will:

1.  **Scaffold a Django project** with an `apps/core` structure for separation of concerns.
2.  **Build custom middleware** to:
    -   Log incoming requests and outgoing responses.
    -   Restrict access to authenticated users or specific user roles.
    -   Block requests from banned IPs or suspicious headers.
    -   Modify or validate incoming JSON payloads.
3.  **Configure the `MIDDLEWARE` stack** correctly in `settings.py` to include both built-in and custom middleware.
4.  **Test middleware behavior** using Postman or Django‚Äôs test client to verify interception, modification, and rejection of requests.
5.  **Document middleware behavior** using inline comments and Markdown files for clarity and maintainability.

#### Best Practices for Project Setup and Middleware Design

Here are some best practices to follow during implementation:

### üìÅ Project Scaffolding Tips

-   Use a modular structure like:

```
  /project-root
    /apps
      /core
        /middleware
        /models
        /views
      /users
      /listings
    /config
    manage.py
```

-   Keep each custom middleware in a separate Python file under `apps/core/middleware/` for clarity.
-   Use environment variables and Django settings to control behavior (e.g., toggle middleware for dev/production).

#### Middleware Best Practices

-   **Keep middleware functions small and focused** ‚Äî avoid bloating a single middleware with multiple responsibilities.
-   **Chain logic properly** ‚Äî always call `get_response(request)` unless rejecting the request early.
-   **Use Django‚Äôs `request.user`, `request.path`, and `request.method`** for clean conditional logic.
-   **Avoid database-heavy logic** in middleware to maintain performance.
-   **Use logging middleware responsibly** ‚Äî log minimal and relevant data to avoid clutter.
-   **Write unit tests** for middleware behavior and edge cases.
-   **Document each middleware** clearly ‚Äî what it does, why it exists, and where it sits in the stack.

#### Limitations and Considerations

While middleware can be powerful, it‚Äôs important to recognize its limitations:

-   Middleware shouldn‚Äôt replace views or serializers for business logic.
-   Middleware runs on **every** request, so poorly optimized code can degrade performance.
-   Order in `MIDDLEWARE` settings matters ‚Äî incorrect ordering may break expected behavior.
-   Some functionalities are better suited for views, decorators, or DRF permissions.

#### üìù Project Assessment (Hybrid)

Your project will be evaluated primarily through **manual reviews**. To ensure you receive your full score, please:

‚úÖ Complete your project on time  
üìÑ Submit all required files  
üîó Generate your review link  
üë• Have your peers review your work

An **auto-check** will also be in place to verify the presence of core files needed for manual review.
