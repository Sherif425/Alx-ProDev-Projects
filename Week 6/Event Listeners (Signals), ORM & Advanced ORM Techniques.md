# Project: Event Listeners (Signals), ORM & Advanced ORM Techniques | Cairo Intranet

### Overview

In modern web applications, **performance**, **modularity**, and **clean architecture** are essential. Django provides powerful tools that help developers build robust and maintainable backend systems. Three core concepts that support these goals are:

1.  **Event Listeners using Django Signals**  
    Signals allow decoupled parts of an application to communicate by emitting and listening to events. This enables actions like sending confirmation emails or logging activities whenever a specific model action (like saving or deleting) occurs‚Äîwithout tightly coupling that logic to your views or models.
    
2.  **Django ORM & Advanced ORM Techniques**  
    Django‚Äôs Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) enables developers to interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL. It also provides advanced tools to optimize performance‚Äîlike `select_related`, `prefetch_related`, and query annotations‚Äîhelping avoid common issues like the N+1 query problem.
    
3.  **Basic Caching**  
    Caching stores frequently accessed data so it can be retrieved faster. Django supports various caching strategies (view-level, template fragment, low-level caching), which can drastically reduce page load time and database load.
    

Together, these techniques improve **application responsiveness**, **database efficiency**, and **code scalability**, making them crucial tools for Django backend developers.

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

-   Explain and implement Django **Signals** to build event-driven features.
-   Use Django **ORM** to perform CRUD operations and write efficient queries.
-   Apply **advanced ORM** techniques for optimizing database access.
-   Implement **basic caching** strategies to enhance performance.
-   Follow **best practices** to ensure maintainable, decoupled, and performant backend code.

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners will be able to:

-   Use Django Signals to decouple side-effects from core business logic.
-   Efficiently retrieve and manipulate database data using Django ORM.
-   Avoid performance issues through query optimization techniques.
-   Implement caching at the view, template, or data level to reduce server workload.
-   Write clean and testable backend logic using Django‚Äôs built-in tools.

### 1\. **Event Listeners Using Django Signals**

#### What are Signals?

Django **Signals** allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers when specific actions have taken place. They‚Äôre useful for triggering side effects like notifications, logging, or updates across different parts of your app.

#### Common Signals:

-   `pre_save` / `post_save`  
    
-   `pre_delete` / `post_delete`  
    
-   `m2m_changed`  
    
-   `request_started` / `request_finished`

#### Best Practices:

-   Keep signal functions lean and avoid long-running tasks.
-   Use the `@receiver` decorator to keep registration clean and explicit.
-   Separate business logic from the signal handler‚Äîcall a service or utility function.
-   Disconnect signals during tests to prevent unwanted behavior.

### 2\. **Django ORM Basics**

#### üîß What is ORM?

The **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)** allows interaction with the database using Python models. You can query, insert, update, and delete records using intuitive syntax without writing raw SQL.

#### Common Operations:

-   Create: `Model.objects.create(...)`
-   Retrieve: `Model.objects.get(...)`, `.filter()`, `.all()`
-   Update: `.save()`, `.update()`
-   Delete: `.delete()`

#### Best Practices:

-   Always catch exceptions like `DoesNotExist` and `MultipleObjectsReturned`.
-   Chain `.filter()` to narrow queries instead of retrieving all data.
-   Validate data before saving.

### 3\. **Advanced ORM Techniques**

#### Tools for Performance:

-   `select_related()` ‚Äì for foreign key optimizations (JOINs).
-   `prefetch_related()` ‚Äì for many-to-many or reverse foreign key optimizations.
-   `annotate()` ‚Äì for aggregations like counts or sums.
-   `Q()` and `F()` ‚Äì for complex queries and field-based calculations.
-   **Custom Managers** ‚Äì to encapsulate and reuse query logic.

#### Best Practices:

-   Avoid repeated queries with eager loading.
-   Use `only()` or `defer()` to limit unnecessary field loading.
-   Profile complex queries using Django Debug Toolbar or `.query`.

### 4\. **Basic Caching in Django**

#### What is Caching?

**Caching** stores the result of expensive computations or database queries to avoid reprocessing. Django supports multiple levels of caching, including per-view, per-template-fragment, and manual (low-level) cache APIs.

#### Common Tools:

-   `@cache_page(60 * 15)` ‚Äì for view-level caching.
-   `{% cache 300 "sidebar" %}` ‚Äì for template fragment caching.
-   `cache.set()`, `cache.get()` ‚Äì low-level caching.

#### Best Practices:

-   Don‚Äôt cache sensitive or user-specific data unless scoped properly.
-   Use cache versioning and meaningful keys.
-   Invalidate/update cache upon data changes using signals or explicit logic.
