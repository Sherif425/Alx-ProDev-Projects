# Project: Git-Flows 

#### Overview

**Git-Flow** is a branching model for Git, proposed by Vincent Driessen, that helps developers manage features, releases, and hotfixes in a consistent and scalable way. It introduces well-defined roles for branches and helps teams coordinate code changes more effectively. Git-Flow is particularly beneficial for large-scale projects where multiple developers work simultaneously on various aspects of the codebase.

Git-Flow revolves around **five primary branch types**:

-   `main` (or `master`) ‚Äì production-ready code
-   `develop` ‚Äì ongoing development
-   `feature/*` ‚Äì new features in progress
-   `release/*` ‚Äì preparation for production releases
-   `hotfix/*` ‚Äì critical bug fixes on the main branch

#### Relevance in the Development Process

Git-Flow improves:

-   **Code organization** by clearly separating development stages
-   **Team collaboration** through structured branching and merging workflows
-   **Code stability** by allowing features to be tested and integrated before reaching production
-   **Release management** by isolating release-specific tasks

Git-Flow is widely adopted in **agile and CI/CD** environments, ensuring seamless integration and deployment pipelines while reducing conflicts and regression bugs.

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this, learners should be able to:

-   Understand the purpose and structure of Git-Flow.
-   Identify the different branch types and their roles.
-   Apply Git-Flow in real-world collaborative development projects.
-   Manage feature development, hotfixes, and release cycles using Git best practices.

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners will be able to:

-   Explain how Git-Flow helps manage large codebases and team contributions.
-   Create and manage branches following the Git-Flow model.
-   Use Git commands to initiate features, releases, and hotfix branches.
-   Integrate Git-Flow into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployments.

#### Git-Flow Best Practices

Best Practice

Description

**Start with `develop`**

Always branch off from `develop` for new features, not `main`.

**Feature Isolation**

Keep each feature in its own branch to reduce merge conflicts.

**Merge via Pull Requests**

Use pull/merge requests for all merges to ensure code review.

**Keep `main` clean**

Only production-ready code goes into `main`. Never push untested code here.

**Tag Releases**

Use Git tags on the `main` branch to mark official release points.

**Use `hotfix/*` for urgent bugs**

Apply emergency fixes directly to `main` via a `hotfix/` branch and merge them back into `develop`.

**Document your workflow**

Maintain clear documentation of your Git-Flow in your project‚Äôs README or internal wiki.

#### Common Git-Flow Commands

```
git flow init                   # Initialize Git-Flow
git flow feature start <name>  # Start a new feature branch
git flow feature finish <name> # Finish feature and merge into develop
git flow release start <x.x.x> # Start a release branch
git flow release finish <x.x.x> # Merge release into main and develop
git flow hotfix start <x.x.x>  # Start a hotfix branch
git flow hotfix finish <x.x.x> # Finish hotfix and merge into main & develop
```

#### üìù Project Assessment (Hybrid)

Your project will be evaluated primarily through **manual reviews**. To ensure you receive your full score, please:

‚úÖ Complete your project on time  
üìÑ Submit all required files  
üîó Generate your review link  
üë• Have your peers review your work

An **auto-check** will also be in place to verify the presence of core files needed for manual review.

##### ‚è∞ Important Note

If the deadline passes, you won‚Äôt be able to generate your review link‚Äîso be sure to submit on time!

We‚Äôre here to support your learning journey. Happy coding! ‚ú®

##### Quiz questions

**Great!** You've completed the quiz successfully! Keep going! (Show quiz)

##### Question #0

Which Git command would you use to combine changes from two branches without altering the commit history?

-   git cherry-pick
    
-   git stash
    
-   git rebase

##### Question #1

What is a key difference between merging and rebasing in Git?

-   Rebasing applies changes from one branch on top of another, while merging combines them.
    
-   Rebasing creates a new branch, whereas merging deletes branches.
    
-   Merging rewrites commit history, while rebasing does not
    
-   Merging always results in conflicts, whereas rebasing never does

##### Question #2

What does the `git cherry-pick` command do?

-   It applies a specific commit from one branch to another.
    
-   It creates a new branch with selected commits
    
-   It merges two branches together.
    
-   It saves uncommitted changes for later use.
    

---

##### Question #3

In the .Gitflow Workflow, what is the purpose of the develop branch?

-   To serve as the main branch for production-ready code
    
-   To back up all commits

-   To integrate all feature branches before merging into master
    

---

##### Question #4

What is the primary purpose of `git stash`?

-   To permanently delete uncommitted changes
    
-   To merge changes from one branch to another.
