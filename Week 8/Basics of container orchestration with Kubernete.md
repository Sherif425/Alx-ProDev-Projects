#### Overview

Container orchestration refers to the automated management, scaling, and networking of containers. **Kubernetes (K8s)** is the industry-standard open-source platform for orchestrating containerized applications. It provides developers and DevOps teams with powerful tools to **automatically deploy, scale, and manage containers**, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance in modern applications.

Kubernetes helps manage clusters of containers running on virtual or physical machines. It abstracts away the infrastructure, allowing teams to focus on **application logic rather than server management**. By leveraging Kubernetes, development teams can embrace continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), microservices architecture, and cloud-native principles efficiently.

#### Objectives

By the end of this, learners should be able to:

-   Understand the core concepts of Kubernetes and container orchestration.
-   Deploy and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes.
-   Explain the relevance of Kubernetes in modern development pipelines.
-   Recognize key Kubernetes components such as **Pods, Nodes, Services, Deployments, and ConfigMaps**.
-   Apply best practices for developing, deploying, and maintaining scalable and reliable systems using Kubernetes.

#### Learning Outcomes

Learners will:

-   Grasp the **purpose and benefits** of container orchestration in software development.  
    
-   Understand the architecture and ecosystem of Kubernetes.  
    
-   Learn to write basic Kubernetes configuration files (YAML).  
    
-   Gain hands-on experience with deploying containers to a Kubernetes cluster.  
    
-   Explore scaling, self-healing, and rolling update mechanisms in Kubernetes.  
    
-   Be able to integrate Kubernetes into a **CI/CD pipeline** for modern DevOps workflows.

#### Best Practices

Here are key best practices when using Kubernetes in development and production:

1.  **Use Declarative Configurations**
    
    -   Define your deployments and services using YAML or Helm charts for version control and reproducibility.
2.  **Separate Concerns with Namespaces**
    
    -   Use namespaces to logically divide environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) and manage resources.
3.  **Use ConfigMaps and Secrets**
    
    -   Store and manage configuration data and sensitive information securely and independently of your containers.
4.  **Health Checks (Liveness & Readiness Probes)**
    
    -   Define clear health checks to allow Kubernetes to detect and replace failing containers automatically.
5.  **Resource Requests and Limits**
    
    -   Always define CPU and memory requests and limits to ensure efficient scheduling and prevent resource starvation.
6.  **Use Labels and Selectors Strategically**
    
    -   Labels help organize, search, and apply operations across resources.
7.  **Monitor and Log Everything**
    
    -   Integrate monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) and logging solutions (ELK, Fluentd) for observability.
8.  **Enable Auto-scaling**
    
    -   Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to adjust to changing loads and optimize resource usage.
9.  **Keep Images Lightweight and Secure**
    
    -   Minimize image size, scan for vulnerabilities, and use trusted base images.
10.  **Regularly Update and Clean Up**
    
    -   Apply security patches, update dependencies, and clean up unused resources to prevent technical debt.

#### Relevance in the Development Process

Kubernetes plays a vital role in **cloud-native development** by supporting microservices, auto-scaling, fault tolerance, and seamless deployments. It empowers teams to:

-   Deploy applications rapidly and reliably.
-   Handle dynamic workloads effortlessly.
-   Implement DevOps and CI/CD practices efficiently.
-   Reduce downtime and improve system resilience.

**Requirements:**

-   `Minikube` for linux

**Objective:** Deploy your containerized Django app on Kubernetes.

**Instructions:**

-   Create a `deployment.yaml` YAML file for your Django messaging app.
    
-   Define the Docker image to be used for the app in the `deployment.yaml` file.
    
-   Expose the Django app via a `Service` (use a `ClusterIP` service to keep it internal).
    
-   Apply the `Deployment` using `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`.
