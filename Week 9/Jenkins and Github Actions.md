# Project: Jenkins and Github Actions | Cairo Intranet

#### **Overview**

This project focuses on setting up a **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline for a Django-based messaging application. The pipeline includes:  
\- **Jenkins** for automated testing, Docker image building, and pushing to Docker Hub.  
\- **GitHub Actions** for running tests, linting checks, code coverage, and Docker image deployment.  
\- **Docker** for containerizing the Django application.

The goal is to automate testing, ensure code quality, and streamline deployment processes.

#### **Learning Objectives**

By completing this project, you will learn how to:  
1\. **Set up Jenkins in Docker** and configure a pipeline for automated testing and Docker builds.  
2\. **Integrate GitHub Actions** to run tests, linting, and code coverage checks.  
3\. **Build and push Docker images** using both Jenkins and GitHub Actions.  
4\. **Secure sensitive credentials** (GitHub, Docker Hub) using Jenkins credentials and GitHub Secrets.  
5\. **Automate workflows** to trigger on code pushes and pull requests.

#### **Key Concepts**

1.  **Continuous Integration (CI)** ‚Äì Automatically running tests and checks on every code change.  
    
2.  **Continuous Deployment (CD)** ‚Äì Automating Docker image builds and deployments.  
    
3.  **Containerization** ‚Äì Using Docker to package the application for consistent deployment.  
    
4.  **Pipeline as Code** ‚Äì Defining Jenkins and GitHub Actions workflows in YAML/Jenkinsfile.  
    
5.  **Code Quality & Testing** ‚Äì Using `pytest`, `flake8`, and coverage reports.

#### **Real-World Use Case**

This setup mirrors real-world DevOps workflows where:  
‚úî **Developers push code** ‚Üí **Automated tests run** ‚Üí **Code quality is checked** ‚Üí **Docker image is built & deployed**.  
‚úî **Teams ensure stability** before merging changes.  
‚úî **Deployments become faster and more reliable** using containerization.

This project helps in understanding **CI/CD best practices**, which are widely used in **startups and large-scale applications** to maintain high-quality software delivery.

### **Next Steps**

-   Extend the pipeline with **Kubernetes deployment**.  
    
-   Add **security scanning** (e.g., Snyk, Trivy).  
    
-   Implement **rolling updates** for zero-downtime deployments.
