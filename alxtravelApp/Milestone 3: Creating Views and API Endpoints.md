# Project: Milestone 3: Creating Views and API Endpoints | Cairo Intranet

### **Overview**

In this task, you will enhance the `alx_travel_app` project by implementing API views to manage **listings** and **bookings**. You‚Äôll create fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints using **Django REST Framework (DRF)** and document them with **Swagger** for ease of access and testing. The focus is on following RESTful API design principles while ensuring endpoints are properly tested for reliability.

### **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this task, learners should be able to:

-   Implement **ViewSets** in Django REST Framework to handle multiple model operations efficiently.
-   Configure API routes using DRF‚Äôs **routers**.
-   Apply RESTful conventions in API endpoint design.
-   Document APIs with **Swagger** for clear and interactive API exploration.
-   Test API endpoints with tools like **Postman** to verify correctness.

### **Learning Outcomes**

Learners will be able to:

-   Create and manage CRUD endpoints for multiple models in Django REST Framework.
-   Integrate automatic API documentation with Swagger.
-   Deploy well-structured and tested API endpoints that follow REST best practices.
-   Confidently test API functionalities for both successful and error scenarios.

### **Key Concepts**

-   **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for API resources.
-   **ModelViewSet**: A DRF class that provides a complete set of CRUD actions without extra boilerplate.
-   **Routers in DRF**: Automatically map ViewSets to URLs in a RESTful format.
-   **Swagger API Documentation**: Automatically generated interactive API docs.
-   **API Testing**: Using tools like Postman to validate API functionality.

### **Tools and Libraries**

-   **Django** ‚Äì High-level Python web framework.
-   **Django REST Framework (DRF)** ‚Äì Toolkit for building Web APIs.
-   **drf-yasg** or **django-rest-swagger** ‚Äì For Swagger documentation generation.
-   **PostgreSQL** (or SQLite) ‚Äì Database for storing listings and bookings data.
-   **Postman** ‚Äì For testing API endpoints.

### **Real-World Use Case**

This task mirrors the backend development process for **travel booking platforms** like **Airbnb**, **Booking.com**, or **Expedia**. These platforms need robust APIs to manage property listings and handle booking requests efficiently. By implementing CRUD endpoints and documenting them with Swagger, developers create scalable, maintainable, and easy-to-test backends that can serve mobile and web applications in real-time.

##### 0\. API Development for Listings and Bookings in Django

mandatory

Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

**Objective**

Build API views to manage listings and bookings, and ensure the endpoints are documented with Swagger.

**Instructions**

-   **Duplicate Project:**
    
    -   Duplicate the project `alx_travel_app_0x00` to `alx_travel_app_0x01`
-   **Create ViewSets**:
    
    -   In listings/views.py, create viewsets for Listing and Booking using Django REST framework‚Äôs ModelViewSet.
    -   Ensure that these views provide CRUD operations for both models.
-   **Configure URLs:**
    
    -   Use a router to configure URLs for the API endpoints.
    -   Ensure endpoints follow RESTful conventions and are accessible under /api/.
-   **Test Endpoints:**
    
    -   Test each endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using a tool like Postman to ensure they work as expected.

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `alx_travel_app_0x01`
-   Directory: `alx_travel_app`
-   File: `listings/views.py, listings/urls.py, README.md`
