# Milestone 3: Creating Views and API Endpoints

-   Novice
-   Weight: 1
-   Project over - took place from Jul 28, 2025 1:00 AM to Aug 4, 2025 1:00 AM
-   **Manual QA review must be done** (request it when you are done with the project)
-   An auto review will be launched at the deadline

#### In a nutshell‚Ä¶

-   **Manual QA review:** Pending
-   **Auto QA review:** 0.0/4 mandatory
-   **Altogether:** waiting on some reviews

### **Overview**

In this task, you will enhance the `alx_travel_app` project by implementing API views to manage **listings** and **bookings**. You‚Äôll create fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints using **Django REST Framework (DRF)** and document them with **Swagger** for ease of access and testing. The focus is on following RESTful API design principles while ensuring endpoints are properly tested for reliability.

### **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this task, learners should be able to:

-   Implement **ViewSets** in Django REST Framework to handle multiple model operations efficiently.
-   Configure API routes using DRF‚Äôs **routers**.
-   Apply RESTful conventions in API endpoint design.
-   Document APIs with **Swagger** for clear and interactive API exploration.
-   Test API endpoints with tools like **Postman** to verify correctness.

### **Learning Outcomes**

Learners will be able to:

-   Create and manage CRUD endpoints for multiple models in Django REST Framework.
-   Integrate automatic API documentation with Swagger.
-   Deploy well-structured and tested API endpoints that follow REST best practices.
-   Confidently test API functionalities for both successful and error scenarios.

### **Key Concepts**

-   **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for API resources.
-   **ModelViewSet**: A DRF class that provides a complete set of CRUD actions without extra boilerplate.
-   **Routers in DRF**: Automatically map ViewSets to URLs in a RESTful format.
-   **Swagger API Documentation**: Automatically generated interactive API docs.
-   **API Testing**: Using tools like Postman to validate API functionality.

### **Tools and Libraries**

-   **Django** ‚Äì High-level Python web framework.
-   **Django REST Framework (DRF)** ‚Äì Toolkit for building Web APIs.
-   **drf-yasg** or **django-rest-swagger** ‚Äì For Swagger documentation generation.
-   **PostgreSQL** (or SQLite) ‚Äì Database for storing listings and bookings data.
-   **Postman** ‚Äì For testing API endpoints.

### **Real-World Use Case**

This task mirrors the backend development process for **travel booking platforms** like **Airbnb**, **Booking.com**, or **Expedia**. These platforms need robust APIs to manage property listings and handle booking requests efficiently. By implementing CRUD endpoints and documenting them with Swagger, developers create scalable, maintainable, and easy-to-test backends that can serve mobile and web applications in real-time.

#### üìù Project Assessment (Hybrid)

Your project will be evaluated primarily through **manual reviews**. To ensure you receive your full score, please:

‚úÖ Complete your project on time  
üìÑ Submit all required files  
üîó Generate your review link  
üë• Have your peers review your work

An **auto-check** will also be in place to verify the presence of core files needed for manual review.

##### ‚è∞ Important Note

If the deadline passes, you won‚Äôt be able to generate your review link‚Äîso be sure to submit on time!

We‚Äôre here to support your learning journey. Happy coding! ‚ú®

## Tasks

##### 0\. API Development for Listings and Bookings in Django

mandatory

Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

**Objective**

Build API views to manage listings and bookings, and ensure the endpoints are documented with Swagger.

**Instructions**

-   **Duplicate Project:**
    
    -   Duplicate the project `alx_travel_app_0x00` to `alx_travel_app_0x01`
-   **Create ViewSets**:
    
    -   In listings/views.py, create viewsets for Listing and Booking using Django REST framework‚Äôs ModelViewSet.
    -   Ensure that these views provide CRUD operations for both models.
-   **Configure URLs:**
    
    -   Use a router to configure URLs for the API endpoints.
    -   Ensure endpoints follow RESTful conventions and are accessible under /api/.
-   **Test Endpoints:**
    
    -   Test each endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using a tool like Postman to ensure they work as expected.

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `alx_travel_app_0x01`
-   Directory: `alx_travel_app`
-   File: `listings/views.py, listings/urls.py, README.md`
