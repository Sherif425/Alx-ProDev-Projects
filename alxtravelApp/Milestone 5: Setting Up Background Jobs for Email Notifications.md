# Project: Milestone 5: Setting Up Background Jobs for Email Notifications | Cairo Intranet

### **Overview**

This task focuses on enhancing the `alx_travel_app` project by implementing asynchronous background processing using **Celery** with **RabbitMQ** as the message broker. The main feature added is an **email notification system** that sends booking confirmations without blocking the main request-response cycle. This ensures improved performance and a better user experience.

### **Learning Objectives**

By completing this task, learners will:

-   Understand how to integrate **Celery** with **RabbitMQ** in a Django application.
-   Learn to configure asynchronous task processing for improved performance.
-   Implement an email notification feature triggered by user actions.
-   Gain experience in working with Django‚Äôs email backend for automated communications.

### **Learning Outcomes**

After completing this task, learners will be able to:

-   Configure and run Celery with RabbitMQ as a message broker.
-   Create and manage shared tasks in Django using Celery.
-   Trigger Celery tasks from Django views or viewsets.
-   Test and verify asynchronous operations such as sending emails.

### **Key Concepts**

-   **Asynchronous Task Processing:** Running time-consuming tasks in the background.
-   **Message Broker:** Middleware (RabbitMQ) used to send and receive task messages between Django and Celery.
-   **Celery Configuration:** Setting up `celery.py` and integrating it into `settings.py`.
-   **Shared Tasks:** Functions decorated with `@shared_task` for execution by Celery workers.
-   **Email Backend in Django:** Configuring SMTP settings for sending automated emails.

### **Tools and Libraries**

-   **Django** ‚Äì Backend web framework for building the application.
-   **Celery** ‚Äì Distributed task queue for background task execution.
-   **RabbitMQ** ‚Äì Message broker to handle communication between Django and Celery.
-   **SMTP Email Backend** ‚Äì For sending booking confirmation emails.

### **Real-World Use Case**

In real-world travel or booking platforms like **Booking.com** or **Airbnb**, sending booking confirmation emails instantly is critical but should not delay the user experience. Using **Celery** with **RabbitMQ**, the email sending process can be offloaded to a background worker, ensuring users receive instant feedback while the system handles notifications asynchronously. This approach is scalable and can also be extended to other time-consuming tasks such as invoice generation, report creation, or SMS notifications.

mandatory

Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)

**Objective**

Configure Celery with RabbitMQ to handle background tasks and implement an email notification feature for bookings.

**Instructions**

-   **Duplicate Project:**
    
    -   Duplicate the project `alx_travel_app_0x02` to `alx_travel_app_0x03`
-   **Configure Celery**:
    
    -   Set up Celery with RabbitMQ as the message broker.
    -   Add Celery configurations in `settings.py` and create a `celery.py` file in the project root.
-   **Define Email Task:**
    
    -   In `listings/tasks.py`, create a shared task function to send a booking confirmation email.
    -   Ensure the email task uses the Django email backend configured in `settings.py`.
-   **Trigger Email Task:**
    
    -   Modify the `BookingViewSet` to trigger the email task upon booking creation using `delay()`.
-   **Test Background Task:**
    
    -   Test the background task to ensure the email is sent asynchronously when a booking is created.
